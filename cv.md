## üéì Education

### üë®üèª PhD (uncompleted) of Sukhoi state technical university of Gomel

***Department*:** 05.13.05 Elements and devices of computer technology and control systems

***Time:*** 2016 ‚Äî 2020

***Research domain:*** computer vision, object detection, vehicles tracking, traffic-light management, optimization

***Summary:*** I was focused on the integration of *intellectual analytics and monitoring* systems of road traffic. My research was concentrated on extraction information from the video stream and building optimization models to reduce traffic-load. I was working on optimization models to be deployed on raspberry pi v3 and similar single board computers.

Systems as I worked on could be used as a supplementary component to tune already existing imitation models to correct traffic-light regimes.

Stretch goal: A city where all roads and traffic-lights know information about road situations every single moment, the system could dynamically change traffic lights regimes to normalize traffic. It is exciting, is not?
