# 🎓 Education

## 👨🏻 2016 — 2020: PhD (uncompleted) of Sukhoi state technical university of Gomel

***Department*:** 05.13.05 Elements and devices of computer technology and control systems

***Research domain:*** computer vision, object detection, vehicles tracking, traffic-light management, optimization

***Summary:*** During my research, I focused on the integration of intelligent analytics and monitoring systems for road traffic.

My research centered on extracting information from video streams and developing optimization models to reduce traffic load. In a city where all roads and traffic lights are aware of road conditions in real time, the system could dynamically change traffic light regimes to normalize traffic flow.

I worked on optimization models that could be deployed on single-board computers. I developed a prototype for car tracking using OpenCV and deep neural networks, and presented my results at several international conferences, and published several papers on the topic.
